Research Topic: Automated spelling checker and grammatical error detection and correction model for the Sinhala language 

Main Objective:  

Our objective is to develop a system that can detect and correct Sinhala grammar and spellings.  

Specific Objectives: 

Spelling error detection 

Spelling error correction 

Grammar error processing (detection) 

Grammar error processing (correction)  

Main Research Question:  

 

Individual Research Question:

The need for a spelling checker integrated with a grammar check is abundant. 

Existing spelling checker projects mostly only perform spelling error detection and suggestions and not spelling correction.

Most of the research the Subject analysis is consider as a Part of Speech tagging it wasn’t considered as a separately module to give more focus on it, so the accuracy depends on that too. 

Also, in research they haven’t covered some main features like animacy, honorific and definite and indefinite of the subject.

The need for a grammar error detector with a predefined grammar rules. 

The grammar error checkers which exist for Sinhala Language for grammar error detection have less accuracy with no suggestion generation for the final grammar checked sentences. 

Individual Objective:  

IT19135830  

The main objective is to develop an automated spelling checker for Sinhala Language. The proposed system comprises of three sub objectives which includes SED. SEC, and text preprocessing.  

Specific Objectives: 

Text Preprocessing  

Spelling error detection   

Spelling error correction

The main goal of the research is to provide a one-stop reliable system which checks and adjusts spellings and grammar of Sinhala by improving upon existing research. The system is primarily categorized as Spelling module and Grammar module. Within the grammar module there are sub parts, out of which Sentence pattern recognition, and tense analysis will be the objectives in this paper.  

Specific Objectives: 

Subject analysis  

Tense analysis   

IT19136134 

The proposed solution for the setbacks in the subject characteristics analysis is to identify its characteristics such Number (Singular or plural), Gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter), Person (1st, 2nd or 3rd), Animate and whether the subject is honorific (e.g.: හු-hu and ඕ-ō, etc..). And output a fully analyzed subject with its characteristics will be generated.   

Specific Objectives: 

Gender Detection  

Animacy detection  

Number detection  

Person detection  

Definite or Indefinite detection.  

Honorific detection  

IT19146652 

The main objective is to detect grammar errors based on grammar rules, to get the final output as a grammatically corrected sentence by performing the grammar error correction and to generate a suggestion generation module.     

Specific Objectives:
